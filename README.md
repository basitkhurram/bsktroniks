The script reads lyrics from training material* and records word patterns.

If a song uses the phrase "word1 word2 word3", the script records that "word2"
can be used after "word1" and that "word3" can be used after "word2".

If given appropriate training material, the raw output can be seen as having
a flavour similar to that of the training material.

See the sample outputs in the root folder for examples of modified outputs.

*NOTE: The lyrics used in the training material are not owned by me.
If the origins of the training material are at all unknown to a user,
the user should not hesistate to contact me for clarification.
