Mother, Mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah

Father, Father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
Oh, what's going on? what's going?
Ya, what's going on? ah, what's going on?

Mother, Mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long?

Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
Oh, what's going on? yeah what's going on?
Tell me what goin' on? I'll tell you what's going on?
