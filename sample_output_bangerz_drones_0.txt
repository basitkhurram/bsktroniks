You can bring me into the court
Make a movie and be a f**king psycho killer!
Scream that It will never stop

I hope we have a party
Me see your ass for the first time
If you're trying to look in the fire before they ask me to 
You win, don't you ever take fail us

We want you
We can't get it
Hurts so miley
It's as good as good to the shadow of loneliness 
When someone rescues you from that shadow
You come in the altar for a f**king psycho

Ooh I’m rootin for my life
I gotta stay to stop
And away we go round
And I so feel you 
I never included these feelings
I got strength, you've got soul
Mercy can kiss us both

I got one of the armies by me 
I'm dancing like you
We can grow but you can't stop weeping in a party
Yeah love, don't you understand 
I can't leave you home without proper authorisation
I know what's been there
A strip club, remember?

Only thing you still want
You will be there
Ain't nothing but you and the party we do
