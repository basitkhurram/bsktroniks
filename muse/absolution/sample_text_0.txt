Both end your grace
There is no one to proclaim eternal world victory
Come on now
It's holding me to a dream of what you and me are
And no one knows who is who on the inside
Your grace, our time is now burning up

Cracks are healing
And I won't let yourself be done with your own hands
There is a life that could be
We want our freedom unbound

And no one really cares
They're just the hell to our time

I won't let you watch this

And we'll pray and forget a kiss that you gave
Good moments flash back
Intertwining memories of absolution

I can see
Battles have begun
I can see change

Everything you bury
Then comes your time
All the reckless things we've done
I just want this to end
All I dream of is the end of this
Everything is the same

I won't let yourself down
If you're falling
And the moment ever comes when all you hope is lost
Feel my beauty chase the candle at both ends

This is your last
All your love is whatever we will ever have
Stay the best you have to be
Hear your soul
