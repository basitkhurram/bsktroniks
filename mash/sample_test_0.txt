Facts are that you never swing on those that make you smile
Even when your ignorance is truly bliss
And watch me like you're addicted
Now I need you

When I'm the only thing promised to you
I hope you cry
I hope I can be the first scar

Why ever stand on your best?

You've created this, you're losing it!
The way I tried to make the murals: with a war

Fuck the mike
Rip the songs into it
I need the shutters set
For when he turns you like a shot
But you tell me that it can be a perfect day

Keep every little piece of love to yourself
Just more lies told to ya 
I tried for a normal one
But who knew you'd give me those fists
Feeling like bullets in my face

I can't resist
I fall asleep hopelessly
I'll love and suppress change
The name of lonely places I've never been
Hopelessly I'll eat away at my soul.

I'm needing everything you wanna take
And now you've got two early graves.
