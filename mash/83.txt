(One, two, three, four.)

Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I have sinned and I am so confused
And I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

I am the Devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk a crooked mile
And I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

If I could have kept on a straight and narrow
If I could have kept on a straight and narrow
And not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart

Now I wake up in the night
It's tugging at my arms and legs
Like I was a marionette

Send baby Jesus
To radiate his light
To radiate his light
