You (you, you)
Were my oppressor
And I (I, I)
I have been programmed to obey

And now (now, now)
You are my handler
And I (I, I)
I will execute your demands

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

Behold (hold, hold)
My trance formation
And you (you, you)
Are empowered to do as you please

My mind (mind, mind)
Was lost in translation
And my heart (heart, heart)
Has become a cold and impassive machine

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

I won't let you control my feelings anymore
And I will no longer do as I am told
And I am no longer afraid to walk alone
Let me go
Let me be
I'm escaping from your grip
You will never own me again
