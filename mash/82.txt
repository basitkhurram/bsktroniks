I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say

Move along
There's nothing left to see
Just a body
Nothing left to see

A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off

Move along
There's nothing left to see
Just a body
Pouring down the street

Move along
There's nothing left to see
Just a body
Nothing left to see

Move along
