Name passed on in hatred
F**k, yeah come on.

The world is all just one deck
So don't take it upon yourself
To go down this road less traveled

A hell that burns crosses
Why would I walk away?
I can see the red white liberal doctrine of militance

It's not that a light study becomes insight
Yell 'cause what more lies can ya tell
And if ya have a perfect fantasy
I won't see you endlessly chase it

Wholly cold within
Stare whenever she can’t help
Dreaming I'm not broken anymore
How did it take me so long?
You stop it and take it back
Let me be just another bombtrack
You're just gonna take what you can
And settle for a Tim McGraw

I can recognise having never seen a sunset
I was walking up by
But if ignorance has come
Ya gonna burn yes
Think Tim McGraw wants only to fist ya

All is lost
Shackled, our souls won't understand change
