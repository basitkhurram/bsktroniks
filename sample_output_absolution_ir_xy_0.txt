Suck the side
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, that's right
How you are you?
Cut out the love you never wanted
Maybe you'll go forwards

But you'll never really come
Floating on a night 
You would understand a little red-blue nightmare

Up this ladder try to go
You can see the ball again
I want you
I heard you're scared 
And I could think you'd never leave
But you get lost and miss them all 
Then you'll go flying

It's never looked hard to phantoms
I - I - I'll hate the world
I only dream I won't know the good time we cherished
Making our house of light ooh-ooh

Say you've seen it now
Falling in that which we are too powerful
Too much it took to bend the shape of the tide
My wings are stuck, your face on the ball
And again you will know
