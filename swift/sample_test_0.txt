Try to get the front seat 
Lucky penny on the ground
It's still so strange to both of us

Back to being together
Let you fumble my undone hair down
Back again with you
And tears roll down again

But if it makes you smile
That's enough for the tapping of my heart

I went looking in the moon for the obvious
But you whisper songs into it
All the night our mamas cried and cried
You did give him to me as far and as far as I can see

You're sitting here begging for a mission
But my life only leads you away

Me in my old faded blue jeans
While you're riding shotgun in this world

The way I feel about you...
I hate that you stay in that distant place
Just past the front porch
After all this time apart

Now you've faked this all
So watch me and realize
Beneath the backyard tree we said: no!
You should be anywhere else

This is cold, how far you're taking me

My old blue eyes full of hope
That you're just invisible

I wish you do well
I'm needing everything from the other half of my soul
