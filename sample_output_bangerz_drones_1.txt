Control what's been through my mind
And breathe without my lungs

You make me go round and round 
I can't live a female rebel
I can't stop the police 
They wanna see what I still got 
I'm empty

I know I thought it was just a lie
The inner building of a psycho killer
Say yeah, do you think I'm free?

Yeah, do what you want and party
We can kiss, who cares?
And I go high in 4D
Then the music slows down

You're running from this moment
Away from me
I am a radicalised drone
You will not be my toughest enemy

Love is in the air 
Let me find my words 
Through the sound of you
My skin feels warm 
To choose one day to go all in
You've felt love
I can love money
We tried, we can't stop the sound of the men in the crowd

Still be strutting my spine 
You're my girl
Alive by my seat
Pimping this big truck
They're all expendable
Incidentally electronically erased by your holiness
