This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around

Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields

Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads

Running through the underground
And this is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna grow old
I just wanna run and hide

Now I'm in a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is your warning
4 minute warning
