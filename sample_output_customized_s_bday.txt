Flip-flop, I am a brother with the lake.
I feel now. Amputate. I don't need for nothing.

A perfect day disappears no more.
Tubes and we'll fly here by the war.

I feel now.
Everything is falling from your room, everyone running out.
Just 'cause you wanna be the only one that knows what you do.
He's gonna wake ya, and you afraid to sleep.
They never say how long.

I'll abandon his mama.
Don't fool yourself, a drunken punch-up at work
Keeping the elite all I was,
But can't learn a smile

You were your bard
Such a death is edge
Eyes of the cat and the vibes of relief.
Relief, relief, relief.

It's tugging, at least you'll be singing
Don't make you walk away with a swastika
But it's late, so he laughs, the beat goes.

So confused, so watch me bury it.
Screaming out how high you never dream anymore
