Crying the sea you scream
All you ever wanted was a line
And the birds came home 
I wonder what is there
To just say it came streaming down from outer space
You don't want somebody listening

You have scattered brains
I'm in your face
You see the bottle
In a couple more I'm going

Nothing is pulling off just cos you fell into outer space
You left to show you can't
You feel low cause nobody has been payin attention
(payin attention, payin attention, payin attention)

You wanted to come home with me in your footsteps
Give yourself up, get that he's gonna stand up in his own way 
I'm taking up my days, my days are moving away
Target that sound, all that you'll keep on the dock

Cause I wanna love
But break up calls and waving twitching
And you learn from the human race
All around bullets all lit up

I am a siren singing
Ooh, I will try...
